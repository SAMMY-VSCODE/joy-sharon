            <h1>Groom's Story</h1>
            <p>It all started in the month of October 2020 <br> when this new girl moved in to a lodge I was also <br> staying. It was time for our evening prayers at the lodge and as I led prayers that night, this “new girl” started singing and the whole atmosphere became charged. <br>
<br>
              Inwardly, I whispered to myself, "I love this grace," <br>  after the prayers ended, we all introduced  <br> ourselves to the New girl. <br>
              <br>
              Several weeks had passed since our first encounter when, <br> I spotted her wearing a geology T-shirt. <br> Excited by the shared interest since I also studied Geology in Uni, <br> I seized the opportunity to strike up a <br> conversation with her on the subject. <br> Little did I know that this casual encounter <br> would become the catalyst for something truly special. <br>
              <br>
              We became really close friends and <br> as our friendship blossomed, I eventually came <br> to the decision that we should be best friends forever.</p>

            <h1>Bride's Story</h1>
            <p>In October 2020, I finally received the long-awaited approval <br> from my parents to relocate to Akure, <br> as the Lord had already instructed me about my impending move in the previous year. <br> During that year, my friend was planning her wedding, <br> so she offered me her place to stay pending when <br> I would find a new place since her rent had not yet expired. <br>
<br>
              The very day I got to Akure, at the lodge where my friend stayed, <br>  another mutual friend of ours invited <br> me for a prayer meeting that regularly held at the lodge. <br> Reluctantly, I joined although I was very tired from the journey. <br>
              <br>
              That evening, there was this young man who led the prayer session <br> with so much passion and unwavering authority. <br> The moment I saw this young man, something leaped in my heart and <br> there was a knowing in my spirit that <br> this is my husband but I wondered how this shall be since there was <br> someone else I was already planning to say “Yes” to. <br>
              <br>
              At first the 'young man' was very unfriendly (or so I assumed) <br> of all the others who stayed at the lodge <br> so I quickly discarded every prompting I had in my spirit <br> towards him until one day — the day he engaged <br> me in a conversation upon seeing me in a “geology” inscribed t-shirt… <br>
              <br>
              Till date, we have never gone a day without talking to each other. The rest they say is history...s
